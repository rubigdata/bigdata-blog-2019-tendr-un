=========== 

It's valentine's day! Let me just add some stuff about something dear to my heart.

*Doctor Who* is a tv show from Britain. It originally started in 1963, and it's still running today (though there was a quite big hiatus in the middle there somewhere). 
I've mostly seen episodes from the 2005 come-back, but Classic Who is quite fun as well. 

>Winning?

>Is that what you think it’s about? 
>I’m not trying to *win*. I’m not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone. 
>It’s not because it’s fun. God knows it’s not because it’s easy. It’s not even because it works because it hardly ever does.. 
>I do what I do because it's **right**! Because it’s decent! And above all, it’s kind! It’s just that.. Just kind. 
>If I run away today, good people will die. If I stand and fight, some of them might live. Maybe not many, maybe not for long. 
>Hey, you know, maybe there’s no point to any of this at all. But it’s the best I can do. 
>So I’m going to do it. 
>And I will stand here doing it until it kills me. And you’re going to die too! Some day.. 
>And how will that be? Have you thought about it? What would you die for? 
>Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand is where I fall. Stand with me. These people are terrified. Maybe we can help a little. 
>Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
